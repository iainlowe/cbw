Christmas – Mass during the Night
 
Note: In selecting music for the Christmas celebrations, liturgical musicians will want to be on communication with their pastors and liturgy committees regarding the Scripture readings to be used, since the selections they make need to flow from the readings. Using well known Christmas carols that are appropriate for the liturgy is particularly helpful in encouraging assemblies to participate in the singing.
The Glory to God is sung throughout the octave of Christmas and during the Sundays of the season.
For the responsorial psalm, see nos. 30, 31, 32, 33, 36, 37, 38 (and 29 for a seasonal option).

Lent – Triduum – Easter Season
 
The Triduum is the high point of the liturgical year, and the way the music is prepared should reflect that. Some large parishes that have several choirs for the Sunday liturgies bring these choirs together into one for the Triduum to give a sense of unity to the three celebrations and an experience of the whole for the members.
 
It is best to choose one setting of the gospel acclamation, eucharistic acclamations, and the Lamb of God to use throughout the season, i.e., one for Lent and another for the Easter season (the best one the parish knows), and use them only during that season. People will eventually become more aware of the season because they associate certain music with that season.
 
Regarding instrumental music during Lent, the 1988 “Circular Letter Concerning the Preparation and Celebration of the Easter Feasts” by the Congregation for Divine Worship says that “musical instruments may be played only to give necessary support to the singing” (no. 17). This implies that instrumental music apart from supporting the singing is used at other times, such as during the time when people are gathering before the liturgy starts as a sign of hospitality to the body of Christ.
 
An optional entrance song for the First Sunday of Lent
 
The “Circular Letter Concerning the Preparation and celebration of the Easter Feasts” suggests the following the First Sunday of Lent: “The first Sunday of Lent marks the beginning of the annual lenten observance. In the Mass of this Sunday there should be some distinctive elements which underline this important moment; e.g., the entrance procession with litanies of the saints” (no. 23).
 
There are several points to consider here. First of all, the directive calls for distinctive elements to mark the beginning of Lent, something such as a piece of music which is repeated every year. Secondly, if the litany of saints is used, note the connection with the Easter vigil, during which the litany of saints is sung during the baptism rite.
 
If the litany of saints is not chosen, an entrance song should be chosen from the list below.

383  Alleluia, Give Thanks                             401  Praise the Lord (Ascension)
 
     Glory to God
This song of praise is omitted during Lent. It is sung (“with bells on”) during the Mass of the Lord’s Supper to mark the beginning of the Triduum and during the Easter vigil (again “with bells on”) when the Triduum reaches its climax. It is sung during all of the Sundays during Easter and also on each of the weekdays in the Octave of Easter.
 
     Responsorial psalms
Musicians are encouraged to use the responsorial psalms provided for each celebration in CBW III. If, however, the assembly is not accustomed to singing a different refrain for each Sunday or the cantors have difficulty learning a new one each week and the parish is better off using a seasonal psalm, seasonal psalms are provided for the five Sundays in Lent and the Sundays of Easter in the hymnal.
 
     Gospel acclamation
During Lent the Alleluia is dropped and another acclamation of praise is used in the gospel acclamation. See CBW III, nos. 258-65. The Alleluia is also not used in other musical settings, such as the Great Amen, and hymns that include the Alleluia are not used.
 
Music for Specific Rites
 
     Ash Wednesday: During the imposition of ashes: Psalm 51 (CBW III 41, 44, 57, 83); 621A Grant to Us, O Lord; 364 Have Mercy on Me.
(Other music may be the same as that for the First Sunday of Lent.)

Ordinary Time
 
Note: The priority for leaders of liturgical music is to have the assembly sing the gospel acclamation, the eucharistic acclamations, and the Lamb of God; these are sung texts. Also, the Glory to God is a hymn text and should be sung. The most important of the hymns are the entrance song and the communion processional.
Parish communities are urged to sing the responsorial psalm assigned for each Sunday. (See CBW III, nos. 115, 118, 121, 124, 127, 130, 133, 136). If, however, an assembly (or a cantor) is not accustomed to singing the responsorial psalm assigned for each Sunday and feast, a seasonal psalm may be used: See no. 114 for suggestions.
